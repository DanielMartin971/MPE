## User Story
As a user in a leadership role at my company, I want to be able to access and manage our database of employee records and projects, so that I can easily delegate tasks and track progress without relying on paper-based systems. This will help me save time and reduce the risk of errors or lost documents, and also help our company meet our sustainability goals by reducing our paper usage. Specifically, I want to be able to view and update employee records, assign tasks and projects to team members, and track the progress of these tasks and projects through the database.
